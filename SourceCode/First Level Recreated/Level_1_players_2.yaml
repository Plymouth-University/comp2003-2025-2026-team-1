# The next 3 sections describe the map layout including what is what and where.
#
# 1. `grid`
# The `grid` describes overall layout.
# Each cell of `grid` has a code (e.g. A1, 02) that is looked-up in `gridObjects`.
#
# 2. `gridObjects`
# Each code in `gridObjects` (e.g. A1, 02) provides a list of objects in this grid position.
# Each object is one of 3 things:
#  a. a code (e.g. B, Pt) which appears in `objectDefinitions`.
#  b. a full object definition (see `objectDefinitions`).
#  c. a combination of both -- a code _and_ customisations that are overlaid on the described object.
#
# Example:
#  By default, you've set beds to face south (you chose code `B` and set the direction in `objectDefinitions`).
#  While that's fine in most places you've used it, you want a few to face east.
#  To make some face east, you can put a customisation which takes priority over the default.
#  Note: another (just as valid) way to achieve the same thing would be to have 2 different `objectDefinition`s -- one facing south, one east.
#
# 3. `objectDefinitions`
# Each code from `gridObjects` (e.g. B, Pt) references one (and only one) object definition.
# An object definition is *at least* a 'known' MapObject.  These are defined by the game and can be found on [[TODO WEBSITE]]!
# Usually an object definition will include more information -- see below.
#
# Object definition:
# Both `gridObjects` and `objectDefinitions` allow describing a MapObject.
# At minimum, that is a code defined when the game was built.  See [[TODO WEBSITE]]
# In addition, the object definition can include:
# - `dir`  : a direction it faces.
# - `mods` : a list of mods (which can optionally include `data` for just this mod).
# - `data` : data that will be provided to *all mods on this MapObject*.
#
# Mods:
# A mod consists of *at least* a mod filename (within the general mods area).
# It can also include `data` for just this mod.

# The map/grid.  A rectangular list of references to `gridObjects` below
# We find it handy to use column-row coordinate naming.
# You can name however you prefer -- as long as it has a value in `gridObjects` below.

# Explanation:
# The grid contains numbers as references to objects on the map.
